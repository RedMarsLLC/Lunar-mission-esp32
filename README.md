# 🌕 Lunar Mission: ESP32-S3 Survival Series 🚀  
Welcome to **Lunar-Mission-esp32** by **RedMars Labs**.  
This is a hands-on, story-driven electronics series built around the **ESP32-S3**, MicroPython, and your creativity.

## 🧭 Story Setting

You’ve crash-landed on the **Moon**.  
With your main systems down and time running out, you must rely on a handful of parts and your embedded programming skills to survive.  
Your only companion? An **ESP32-S3 dev board**, some **LEDs**, a **buzzer**, and your **ingenuity**.

Can you build a beacon? Signal Earth? Monitor your life systems?  
You’re the mission commander now.  
Let’s get to work.

## 📦 What's Inside

Each mission introduces a real-world embedded concept through a fictional scenario, guiding you step-by-step with MicroPython code and circuit diagrams.

| Mission | Title | Concepts |
|--------|-------|----------|
| ✅ Mission 1 | [Lunar Beacon](missions/Mission1_Lunar_Beacon.md) | Blinking LED, Breadboarding, Pin Control |
| ✅ Mission 2 | [Silent SOS](missions/Mission2_Silent_SOS.md) | PWM, Buzzer Signals, Morse Code |
| ✅ Mission 3 | [Lunar Lockdown](missions/Mission3_Lunar_Lockdown.md) | Morse via Button, Input Handling, Communication Logic |
| ✅ Mission 4 | [Telemetry Touchdown](missions/Mission4_Telemetry_Touchdown.md) | Wi-Fi AP Mode, HTML Web UI, Morse via Browser |
